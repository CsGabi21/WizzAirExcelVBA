# WizzAirExcelVBA
REST GET call for WizzAir flights from Budapest/Debrecen to all available destinations.

Instruction:
  Open WizzAir.xlsm and set the date range on the first row which would like to GET the flights prices.
  
  If you want to know only one destination then you have to delete the different places name with whole row.
  
  You hold that destination which one interested you.
  
If you run the macro for all place with three month range, it will be very slow. It will about an hour.
Of course the process will be faster that if you decrease the month range and destinations rows.
