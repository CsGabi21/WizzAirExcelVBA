# WizzAirExcelVBA
REST GET call for WizzAir flights from Budapest/Debrecen to all available airport.

Instruction:
  Open WizzAir.xlsm and set the date range on the first row which would like to GET the flights prices.
  
  If you want to know only one landing ground then you have to delete the different place name with whole row.
  
  You hold that place which one interested you.
  
If you run the macro for all place with three month range, it will be very slow. It will about an hour.
Of course it will faster that if you incrase the month range and the landing ground rows.
